"""
A restaurant recommendation system.

Here are some example dictionaries that correspond to the information in
restaurants_small.txt.

Restaurant name to rating:
# dict of {str: int}
{
    'Georgie Porgie': 87,
    'Queen St. Cafe': 82,
    'Dumplings R Us': 71,
    'Mexican Grill': 85,
    'Deep Fried Everything': 52
}

Price to list of restaurant names:
# dict of {str: list of str}
{
    '$': ['Queen St. Cafe', 'Dumplings R Us', 'Deep Fried Everything'],
    '$$': ['Mexican Grill',],
    '$$$': ['Georgie Porgie'],
    '$$$$': []
}

Cuisine to list of restaurant names:
# dict of {str: list of str}
{
    'Canadian': ['Georgie Porgie'],
    'Pub Food': ['Georgie Porgie', 'Deep Fried Everything'],
    'Malaysian': ['Queen St. Cafe'],
    'Thai': ['Queen St. Cafe'],
    'Chinese': ['Dumplings R Us'],
    'Mexican': ['Mexican Grill']
}

Given this data, a price of '$' and a list of cuisines like ['Chinese', 'Thai'],
we would produce the following list, which is sorted according to the ratings:

    [[82, 'Queen St. Cafe'], [71, 'Dumplings R Us']]
